# Introducing Myself

Hi, my name is Joanne.ðŸ‘‹

I am excited about embarking on a career as a data analyst
My taste for data and analytics began during my employment within the healthcare service. I have over 10 yearsâ€™ experience working in data management producing accurate and reliable audits and reports, presenting data insights and influencing strategies and decisions in improving programmes performance.
Enrolling onto a level 3 data skills bootcamp kick started this exciting journey into becoming a data analyst. This experience has enabled me to thrive, broaden my skills and knowledge within the data world and exercise my problem-solving skills and allow my creative nature to flourish.
