# Introducing Myself

Hi, my name is Joanne.ðŸ‘‹

I am excited about embarking on a career as a data analyst. My interest in data and analytics originated during my tenure in the healthcare service. With over 10 years of experience in data management, I have consistently produced accurate and reliable audits and reports. I have also been instrumental in presenting data insights and influencing strategies to improve program performance.

Enrolling in a Level 3 data skills bootcamp kickstarted this exciting journey toward becoming a data analyst. This experience has not only allowed me to thrive but has also broadened my skills and knowledge within the data world. It has provided me with opportunities to exercise my problem-solving skills and allowed my creative nature to flourish.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
